# ASCII-Notes
- This app was an attempt by me at somewhat replicating latex and create some notes that can be saved to local storage. 
- Press the save button to save your text to your local storage so that is then retrieved upon refreshing the page
- This started as trying to replicate Latex but ended up serving as a really good web app to display ASCII art as well
